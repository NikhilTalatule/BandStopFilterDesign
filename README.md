# Wide Band Reject Filter

## Overview

This repository contains a project report on the implementation of a Wide Band Reject Filter, submitted as part of the third-year coursework for Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering at Yeshwantrao Chavan College of Engineering, Nagpur. The project aims to design and develop a filter circuit that rejects a specific band of frequencies while allowing other frequencies to pass through.

## Introduction

A wide band-stop filter, also known as a band-reject or band-elimination filter, is a circuit that rejects a specific range of frequencies while passing all other frequencies. This project focuses on the design and implementation of such a filter using operational amplifiers (op-amps) and passive components like resistors and capacitors.

The filter is designed to have a low cut-off frequency (f_L) for the high-pass section and a high cut-off frequency (f_H) for the low-pass section. The frequencies between these two cut-off points are attenuated, creating a band-stop or band-reject response.

## Components

The following components were used in the implementation of the Wide Band Reject Filter:

- Resistors: 3.30 kΩ (1), 10 kΩ (6), 16 kΩ (2)
- ICs: 741 op-amp (3)
- PCB (1)
- Connecting wires
- Capacitors: 100 nF (2)

## Circuit Diagram

The circuit diagram for the Wide Band Reject Filter is included in the project report. It illustrates the connections between the components and the overall design of the filter circuit.

## Simulation

The project report includes simulation results obtained using Multisim software. The input and output waveforms are presented, demonstrating the band-reject behavior of the filter.

## Applications

Wide Band Reject Filters have various applications in different technologies and industries, including:

- Electric guitar amplifiers (to reduce 60 Hz hum)
- Communication electronics (to eliminate unwanted harmonics and noise)
- Radio receivers (to reduce static)
- Optical communication (to remove spurious light frequencies)
- Image and signal processing (to reject noise)
- High-quality audio applications (PA systems)
- Medical instruments (EGC for removing line noise)
